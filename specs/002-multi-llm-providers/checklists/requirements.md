# Specification Quality Checklist: Multi-Provider LLM Compatibility (Anthropic & OpenAI)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- Provider names (OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI) are retained as product/scope identifiers,
  not implementation detail — they define the feature boundary requested by the user.
- All validation items pass on the first iteration; no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were
  required because reasonable defaults exist for the open decisions (single active provider,
  no automatic failover), which are recorded in the Assumptions section.
